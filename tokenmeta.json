  "description": "Flash USDT is a BEP-20 community token (on-chain name Tether USD, symbol USDT) designed for transparent payments, rewards, and liquidity-backed transactions within our own ecosystem. Each token is supported by verifiable on-chain liquidity, and 10% of every reward distribution is permanently added to the liquidity pool, ensuring sustainable growth and market depth. The token operates on a soft-pegged model, focusing on transparency and controlled supply rather than a hard stablecoin peg. ⚠️ Note: Flash USDT is a completely independent project and not affiliated with or equivalent to the official Tether (USDT) stablecoin issued by Tether Ltd.",
